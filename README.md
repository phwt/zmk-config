# phwt's Jorne Keymap

Keymap for [Jorne](https://github.com/joric/jorne) ([Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) with 1 extra key on each half) optimized for coding and typing in Thai Kedmanee layout. Currently, the layout is still **working in progress** as some keys are still hard to reach or often get misfired.

## Features

- No [home-row mod](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) usage, all mods are accessible without the help of mod-tap or layers.
  - With the exception of rarely used <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (in macOS) being in mod-tap with <kbd>ESC</kbd>.
- Layers:
  - Type layer:
    - Move symbols closer to the middle because even though Jorne have enough space for the brackets and curly braces I still struggle to press them because of my weak right pinky.
    - Inverted arrow cluster on the right-half enables the usage with only the right hand.
    - This is called the type layer because the number keys is used for some characters in Thai Kedmanee.
  - Function layer: function keys, media control and macros.
  - Adjust layer: bluetooth profile and output management.
- _To be added_

## Needs improvement

Things that I still found unpleasant about this keymap.

- Uncomfortable <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key placement.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> key too far for thumb in some combinations.
- Redundant <kbd>Right-âŒ˜</kbd> which is exclusively used for app switching with [rcmd](https://lowtechguys.com/rcmd/)
- _And many more..._
